Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and maintaining software. 
Importance
Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
Advent of structured programming in 1970s
Rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement- gathering information of what the software should have.
Design - creating designs of user interface and software architecture.
Development - Coding begins to build the software according to design specifications.
Testing - Examine the software with tests for bugs.
Implementation - Run the software.
Maintenance - Provide support and updates to the software after implelmenting it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential while agile methodology is iterative.
Waterfall methodology is less flexible while agile methodology is highly flexible.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
QA Engineer- makes sure the software product meets quality standards and executes test plans.
Project manager- oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE - they help facilitate the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code. Example: Visual Studio Code
VCS - they help track and monitor changes made to the software over time. Example: Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
Scope creep- requirements changing over time, meaning the design and the code has to change as well.
Strategies to overcome the challenges: effective communication, agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Testing small parts of the software (units) separately to make sure they work correctly.
Integration testing- Testing different modules together to see if they work correctly.
System testing- Testing the system as a whole to see if does what it is supposed to.
Acceptance testing- Having a user try the system and examine their satisfaction by it.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is maths? What is multiplication in maths?
